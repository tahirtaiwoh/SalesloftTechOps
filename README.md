  <h1 align="center"> Here are the steps to create the API, Dockerize the application, and create Kubernetes deployment files: </h1>
</p>

Step 1: Create the API
For this example, let's choose the "Chuck Norris Jokes" API from https://api.chucknorris.io/.

Step 2: Dockerize the application
Next, let's create a Dockerfile to package our application. Create a file called Dockerfile in 
This Dockerfile uses the official Python 3.9 image and sets the working directory to /app. It then copies the requirements.txt file to the container, installs the dependencies, and copies the rest of the code to the container. Finally, it sets the command to run the app.py script.

Step 3: Deployment files for Kubernetes
Now that we have a Docker image, we need to create Kubernetes deployment files.
This deployment file defines a single replica of our application and uses the Docker image we built earlier. It exposes port 5000 for our Flask app.
Next, let's create a file called service.yaml
This service file creates a LoadBalancer that exposes our app on port 80.

Step 4: Build and push the Docker image
Before we can deploy our application to Kubernetes, we need to build and push the Docker image to a registry. Let's use Docker Hub for this example.
